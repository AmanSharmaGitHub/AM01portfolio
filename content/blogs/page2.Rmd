# Gapminder: snapshot of global living standards over time

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r picture1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/hansrosling.jpeg", error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "Greece") # just choosing Greece, as this is where I come from

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Europe")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
NULL 

plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
plot1 <- plot1 +
labs(title = "Life Expectancy Trends over Time",
     x="Year",y="Life Expectancy") + NULL

plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from. (Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
ggplot(gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp, colour= country, group =country))+
geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year, y =lifeExp, colour=country ))+
geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
facet_wrap(~continent) +
theme(legend.position="none") +
NULL
```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Type your answer after this blockquote.
From the graphs it seems that there has been more of a convergence in life expectancy in the more developed continents, whereas a divergence in the less developed.
This may be due to the fact that more developed economies have been able to invest in better healthcare and technology that has been shared across the continent. This factor of information and technology spread is also likely to be correlated with economic development.
